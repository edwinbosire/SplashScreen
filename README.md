#CoreAnimation SplashScreen

I've always been intrigued by Twitter's splash screen. I also wanted to prototype something quickly using Playground. I reckon this is the best time to do all this.

## How to run.

1. Clone the project
`git clone https://github.com/edwinbosire/SplashScreen.git`

2. Show the assistant editor **⌥⌘⏎ (Option + Command + Enter)**

3. Execute playground Alt+CMD+Shift
